# Graphic Designer Portfolio

This is my recently graduated partner's portfolio. She wanted a super simple and sleek design with capacity for lots of images and content, and together we came up with this.

## Features

- Next.js App Router + Vercel
- Optimized for SEO (sitemap, robots, JSON-LD schema)
- Tailwind CSS ([v4.0]([https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4)))
- Vercel Speed Insights / Analytics

## Getting Started

### Clone and Deploy

Prerequisites: Node.js, npm, pnpm.

Clone this repo and install local dependencies.

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The site will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

This site is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying)).

## Todo/Issues

- More use of components!
- CMS integration (see branch)
- Improve markup for tag section underneath titles (use a list and CSS for separators?)
- Add class `text-lg` to base style of `<p>` element, then fix any conflicts with smaller text use
