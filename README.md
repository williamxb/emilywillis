# Graphic Design Portfolio

This is my recently graduated partner Emily's portfolio. Emily wanted a super simple and sleek design with capacity for lots of images and content, and together we came up with this.

## Features

- Next.js + Vercel
- Optimized for SEO (sitemap, robots, JSON-LD schema)
- Tailwind CSS ([v4 alpha](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha))
- Vercel Speed Insights / Analytics
