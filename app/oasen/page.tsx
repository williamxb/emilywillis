      <p className="text-lg">Oasen is a skincare brand for young neurodiverse individuals, offering a sensory-safe product range and an accommodating pop-up store experience that creates an environment to foster confidence and skin health.</p>

      <ImageWithLightbox src={oasen01} alt="" priority={true} />

      <p className="text-lg">My group partner Ju and I decided to focus on sensory issues that neurodiverse people face. Our solution was to create a brand, Oasen, which shows skin diversity, has sensory-safe products, creates community through a pop-up store and or line, uses positive language and is accessible.</p>

      <ImageWithLightbox src={oasen08} alt="" />

      <p className="text-lg">Oasen was a research heavy project, ensuring that we understood the audience as well as possible, taking their feedback into consideration when we planned the pop-up shop experience and designed the brand.</p>

      <p className="text-lg">We decided to name the brand Oasen as a spin on the word 'Oasis' meaning a safe space, a sanctuary.</p>

      <p className="text-lg">The blob illustrations were inspired by lava lamps, which are a sensory light, and can be used as a visual stim.</p>
