      <p className="text-lg">Inspired by '<i className="font-italic">Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zone</i>' I decided to do a project focusing on helping elderly women become more active. Dance was one of the activities that increased longevity in the blue zones.</p>
      <p className="text-lg">'Keep Dancing' is a campaign launched by the 'NHS' in collaboration with 'Strictly Come Dancing', sending information packs to elderly women, teaching them basic dance moves and offering a range of fun, sociable dance classes in their local area. This will help women aged 75 and over have easy access to resources for dance and an easier way of finding classes in their local area.</p>

      <p className="text-lg">Only 43% of people over the age of 74 are physically active in the UK, with women being less physically active than men, Only 29.9% of females believe they have the opportunity to be physically active in the UK (Sport England, 2024).</p>
      <p className="text-lg">With Strictly Come Dancing being one of the most popular reality shows among elderly women, I decided to use it as a way to design a campaign, making dance fun and accessible for elderly women.</p>

      <ImageWithLightbox src={keepdancing02} alt="" />

      <p className="text-lg">I brought together the Strictly Come Dancing colour palette and 1960s design to create a fun, fresh, yet nostalgic campaign design.</p>
